[Computer Security for Lawyers](http://greenbag.org/v20n2/v20n2_articles_albert.pdf) is now out in the Green Bag! The Green Bag is one of my favorite legal publications, and I’m honored that a journal of entertaining things chose to publish my paper.&nbsp;

<!-- more -->

Computer Security Lawyers is a paper about some relevant computer security concepts for lawyers who want to protect their client’s information. It’s not meant to be a dumbed down version, but rather, a condensed and targeted set of pieces of advice.

At some point, I may also update it to reflect the current state of the art, but for the moment, I’m just thrilled that it exists in print! You can read it here:&nbsp;[http://greenbag.org/v20n2/v20n2\_articles\_albert.pdf](http://greenbag.org/v20n2/v20n2_articles_albert.pdf)

Thank you to Marcia Hofmann, Wendy Knox Everette, Greg Norcie, Maggie Delano, Bruce Schneier, Luis Villa, and Vivek Krishnamurthy for their feedback, as well as Joseph Lorenzo Hall for his encouragement.
