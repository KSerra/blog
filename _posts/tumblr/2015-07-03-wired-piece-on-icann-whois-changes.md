Sarah Jeong and I have an op-ed in WIRED about how a proposal floated in a working group at ICANN could have profound consequences for people being harassed online. Check it out [here](http://www.wired.com/2015/07/unassuming-web-proposal-make-harassment-easier/).

Along with other activists, we have created a [coalition letter](http://onlineabuseprevention.org/letter-to-icann-july-2015/) to submit as part of the ICANN public comment process. I’m glad we’re getting to make sure that this important part of this issue is heard.
