I’m not normally a New Year’s Resolution kind of person - in fact, I told my roommate that this year I would resolve to wash the dishes on Jan. 1st and call it a day. I did that, but then I stumbled upon a [Slate article](http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2012/12/new_year_s_resolutions_reading_a_book_every_day.html) where the author undertook to read a book a day for a year.&nbsp;

Like most avid readers, I have what someone on Twitter called “the pile of shame” - books that I’ve promised that I’m going to read someday. (For me, it’s two piles on my desk and a corresponding larger set that lurks in my bookshelf.) Often, my reading eyes are bigger than my stomach (or my propensity to buy books on Amazon) and frankly, I haven’t made much progress on any of these in months.<!-- more -->

Below, the current iteration of the pile of shame.<figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="375" data-orig-width="500"><img alt="The current iteration of the book pile." src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/651b960af5135b0ad872ac0439aa5d5d/a15477a9f9ea1c6f-a8/s540x810/b94065193b7e6f8b23b516c0b63eb9eb04f2aa00.jpg" data-orig-height="375" data-orig-width="500"></figure>

So, reading a book a day would be pretty cool.&nbsp;However, that pace would probably require giving up a number of activities I also enjoy &nbsp;- video games, watching bad TV, cooking - and would become completely ridiculous when I enter school in the fall. Looking into the new year, I see setting some book goals as a way to get over my always-full pile of “books to read” and to have a way of incentivizing reading over screen-staring time.&nbsp;

I also have become inspired by my friend&nbsp;[Diana Kimball](http://blog.dianakimball.com/)‘s&nbsp;experiments&nbsp;with public reading, and want a way to engage in more of a dialogue/reflective process around what I’m reading.&nbsp;So I’m embarking on a customized version of the challenge. Here are the rules:

- I will read 260 books by January 1st, 2014.&nbsp;
- I will write a blog post for every 5 books I read - as a way of checking in. This may be every week (or less, or more, depending on a number of factors.)
- Audiobooks don’t count.
- Graphic novels do.&nbsp;
- Since the goal is to lower the number of books that I’ve gotten 10 pages into and never finished, finishing books I’ve started is allowed.
- I will try NOT to just read the shortest or most&nbsp;convenient&nbsp;books -the blog posts are a way of ensuring that I stay honest about this.&nbsp;
- I’m going to try for a mix of fiction and non-fiction. A lot of what I have lying around is non-fiction, but there’s always the [Tournament of Books](http://www.themorningnews.org/article/announcing-the-2013-tournament-of-books).

So, without further ado, the first five:

[One Good Turn](http://www.amazon.com/One-Good-Turn-Natural-Screwdriver/dp/0684867303/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1357503271&sr=8-5&keywords=one+good+turn): A Natural History of the Screwdriver and the Screw by Witold Rybczynski, [Women Don’t Ask](http://www.amazon.com/Women-Dont-Ask-Negotiation---Strategies/dp/0553383876/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1357503310&sr=1-1&keywords=Women+Don%27t+Ask): The High Cost of Avoiding&nbsp;Negotiation&nbsp;– and&nbsp;Positive&nbsp;Strategies for Change by Linda Babcock and Sara Laschever,&nbsp;[In Other Worlds](http://www.amazon.com/Other-Worlds-SF-Human-Imagination/dp/0307741761/): SF and the Human Imagination by Margaret Atwood, [The Law of Superheroes](http://www.amazon.com/Law-Superheroes-James-Daily/dp/1592407269/) by James Daily and Ryan Davidson, [Both Flesh and Not](http://www.amazon.com/Both-Flesh-David-Foster-Wallace/dp/0316182370/): Essays by David Foster Wallace - which was the [24 Book Club](http://www.24hourbookclub.com/) book.

In the service of having some sort of record abou this project, I’m going to write a few words, and put each book in a category at the end of the 5-book period.

**Best Written:** Both Flesh and Not (not shockingly). This was my first DFW book, and there were many parts of it that I loved.

**Worst:** One Good Turn, by a huge margin. It was terrible - badly written, self-indulgent, low on content and ultimately unsatisfying.

**Most Useful:** Women Don’t Ask, which came highly recommended by many other women geeks.

**Book I was most excited to read:** &nbsp;The Law of Superheroes, which turned out to be okay. I was unhappy about the level of&nbsp;certainty&nbsp;that the authors seemed to come to on each question (things like: “Would Wolverine’s claws count as arms under the 2nd amendment?”). To me, the back and forth about the&nbsp;uncertainty&nbsp;is more interesting, so I came away a little disappointed.

**Book I’ve had for the longest:** &nbsp;In Other Worlds, which was good but&nbsp;repetitive.&nbsp;
