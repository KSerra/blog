This week, I co-edited the intellectual property newsletter Five Useful Articles (one of the [six most popular email newsletters](http://www.fastcompany.com/3033338/most-creative-people/tips-on-crafting-a-popular-newsletter-from-top-newsletter-authors?utm_campaign=home&utm_source=tumblr&utm_medium=exchange&partner=tumblr) on Tiny Letter) with my friend, Parker Higgins.

Continuing my trend of linking out to cool things I’ve done, it’s available [here](http://t.co/5zknZmS5RE). Once you’re done reading, you should subscribe - it’s great every week, even when I’m not co-editing.&nbsp;
