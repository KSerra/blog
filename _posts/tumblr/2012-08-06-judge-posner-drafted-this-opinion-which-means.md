title: Judge Posner drafted this opinion, which means that (as usual for him) it reads
  like a barely edited first-draft. As usual for Seventh Circuit opinions, it makes
  a number of questionable and undefended offline analogies, makes assumptions about
  factual questions that could/should be remanded to the district court, barely engages
  with or cites to other legal precedent, raises and addresses issues that the litigants
  never raised, and is filled with gratuitous digressions (e.g., an uncomfortable
  discussion that gay ethnic pornography might be illegal, a contention neither party
  advanced; and an odd discussion about the reputational capital benefits of sharing
  content).
