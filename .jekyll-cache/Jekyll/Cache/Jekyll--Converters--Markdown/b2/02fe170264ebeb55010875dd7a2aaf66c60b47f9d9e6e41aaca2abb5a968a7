I"g<p>It’s been a while since I updated this blog - and although part of that is because I’ve been lazy, the other reason is because I just started a new one as well. It’s called “Long Distance Cooking Challenge” - and it’s a food blog and a collaboration with my friend Jasmine. Check it out at <a href="http://distavore.tumblr.com/">here</a>.</p>
