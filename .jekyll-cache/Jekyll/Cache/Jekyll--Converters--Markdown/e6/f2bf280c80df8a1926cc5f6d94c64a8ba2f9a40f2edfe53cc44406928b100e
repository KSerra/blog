I"þ<p>I have a new draft paper out! Itâ€™s called <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2831739">Computer Security Tools and Concepts for Lawyers</a>. I wrote this paper because I often find that lawyers outside of tech spaces didnâ€™t understand fundamental computer security concepts, like what encryption does, or what social engineering is. I also wanted a piece pitched at the right level for lawyers who just want to know how to do a better job at protecting client information.Â </p>
