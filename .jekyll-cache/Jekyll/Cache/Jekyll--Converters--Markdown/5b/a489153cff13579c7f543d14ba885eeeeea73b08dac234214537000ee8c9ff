I"ž<p>Iâ€™m not normally a New Yearâ€™s Resolution kind of person - in fact, I told my roommate that this year I would resolve to wash the dishes on Jan. 1st and call it a day. I did that, but then I stumbled upon a <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2012/12/new_year_s_resolutions_reading_a_book_every_day.html">Slate article</a> where the author undertook to read a book a day for a year.Â </p>
