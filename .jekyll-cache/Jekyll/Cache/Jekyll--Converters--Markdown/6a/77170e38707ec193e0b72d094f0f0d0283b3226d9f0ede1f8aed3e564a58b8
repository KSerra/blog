<p>Liarâ€™s Poker, The Magicians, The Age of Dreaming, The Alchemist, Ash</p>

<p>Ugh, 5 books and none of them were really that good.Â <!-- more --></p>

<p>Another week, another book that is free from the Kindle Lending Library that talks about finance. I had enjoyed Boomerang and The Big Short, so figured Iâ€™d return to Liarâ€™s Poker, where Michael Lewis first got his start. Itâ€™s much more of a personal memoir and is not meant to teach high finance concepts. Originally written in the 80s, itâ€™s not going to tell a reader who picks it up now anything they didnâ€™t know about about Wall Street. At the time, the notion that traders were self-serving know - graduates of top schools might have been shocking, but now itâ€™s just par for the course.</p>

<p>The Magicians is a dark take on Harry Potter/Narnia. Given that, I was kind of expecting to love it but I didnâ€™t. Heavy on the navel gazing, with a utterly uncompelling main character. So many better books I could have read.</p>

<p>The Age of Dreaming is a historical fiction book about the silent film industry, from the perspective of a (fictional) Japanese film star. Itâ€™s by the same author as Southland, and handles a lot of the same themes. The narrative style is a bit clunky, with lots of flashbacks to past times - it would have been more effective if the author had just told the story in the moment rather than attempting to set main story in present day. Worth a read if youâ€™re particularly interested in silent film, I guess.</p>

<p>The Alchemist - somehow I missed this book in high school. I read lots of Paulo Coelho, and I remember like Veronika Decides to Die much better than this. Super quick read, not particularly life changing (despite what the back cover says).</p>

<p>Ash is a lesbian retelling of Cinderella. Itâ€™s not particularly well written - too many subplots, and too much going on, but I liked the ending, and enjoyed how the author played with the fair tale tropes.</p>
