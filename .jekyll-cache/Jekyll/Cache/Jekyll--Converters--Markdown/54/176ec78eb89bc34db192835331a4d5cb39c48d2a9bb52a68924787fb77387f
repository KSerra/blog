I"ö<p>I wrote a long reflective post about my first semester of law school and how I feel that the legal educational system sets people up for failure by forcing them to give up things that are important to them.</p>

<p>But just writing it made me sad and a little annoyed, so posting it here would make me sadder. Iâ€™ll explain at some point. But for now, have a list of things that make me happy.<!-- more --> In no particular order:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Cooking something that I really want to eat and having it turn out just the way I like it.</li>
  <li>Gordon Ramseyâ€™s Best Restaurant, which is on Netflix and makes me feel warm and fuzzy inside.Â </li>
  <li>Scarves.</li>
  <li>Winning board games the first time I play them.</li>
  <li>Badass boots that fit perfectly.</li>
  <li>The Measure of Injury, by Martha Chamallas and Jennifer Wiggins.</li>
  <li>Taking out the trash bins just before the garbage truck shows up.</li>
  <li>Pho.</li>
  <li>Sitting in the hot tub at Inman Oasis (which isnâ€™t sketchy I swear) and just breathing.</li>
  <li>Quiet museums full of contemporary art.</li>
  <li>The album Bodyparts by Dragonette.</li>
  <li>The <a href="https://twitter.com/FacesPics">Faces in Things Twitter account</a>).</li>
  <li>Hearing about cool research projects people are working on.</li>
  <li>Checked off to-do lists.</li>
  <li>Playing <a href="http://www.ingress.com/">Ingress</a>.Â </li>
</ol>

<p>May your holidays and 2014 be filled with things that make you happy, whatever those things are.</p>
