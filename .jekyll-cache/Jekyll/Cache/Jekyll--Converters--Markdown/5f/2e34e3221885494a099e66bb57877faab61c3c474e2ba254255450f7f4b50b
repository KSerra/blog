I"4<p>Wow, I’m behind on blogging books. A couple weeks ago, I read Dawn, Adulthood Rites, Imago, Cairo: A Graphic Novel and Chicken with Plums<figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="146" data-orig-width="500"><img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/754979f08e514fed2cd647e8afd44d12/135a7976a4714971-65/s540x810/9d695e7a7a14b6b14af3de95726f45e46e3775e2.png" data-orig-height="146" data-orig-width="500" /></figure></p>

<p>Dawn, Adulthood Rites and Imago are all part of Octavia Butler’s Xenogenesis trilogy, which is about an alien species that reinvigorates the human race after a massive catastrophe. I read these because I enjoyed Kindred so much, and they’re arguably the most famous of Octavia Butler’s works. I wasn’t blown away. It’s certainly imaginative - no run of the mill aliens here, and the writing is strong, but the stories didn’t hook me the same way Kindred did. Also, there’s a lot of nonconsensual sex in these books - it’s not portrayed as rape, but it’s pretty squicky if you’re someone who is invested in consent culture.</p>

<p>Chicken with Plums is a graphic novel by Marjane Satrap, the author of Persepolis. Similar art style, different in subject material - it focuses on an Iranian musician and his relationship with his music, his instrument, and his desire to die. A little morbid, but good. </p>

<p>Cairo: A Graphic Novel is by G. Willow Wilson, who I had heard great things about. It was great - good art, fun story arc, an interesting mix of characters and a fast read.  Definitely reading more of her work.</p>
