I"<p>Jonathan Zittrain, Larry Lessig and I have been working on a paper laying out some empirical evidence of linkrot and reference rot in law review and Supreme Court citations, and proposing a solution, which is called <a href="http://www.perma.cc">Perma.cc</a>. Our research found that 49% of links in SCOTUS opinions and between 60-70% of journal links are broken - a huge number that only increases as time passes. The full results are available at the draft on <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=2329161">SSRN</a>. </p>
