I"<p>When you buy a video game, you expect to be able to play it for as long as you want. You expect be able to play it with your kids many years from now if you want (well, maybe not Grand Theft Auto).  And you would hope that museums and media historians could preserve the games that were so important to your childhood. But unfortunately, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act’s <a href="https://www.eff.org/issues/dmca-rulemaking" title="DMCA Rulemaking">anti-circumvention provisions</a> (17 U.S.C. § 1201, or Section 1201) creates legal risks for players who want to keep playing after game servers shut down, and curators who want to preserve games for posterity. That’s why I’m spearheading an effort to win legal protection for game enthusiasts and preservationists who want to keep abandoned games alive by running multiplayer servers or eliminating authentication mechanisms. On Friday, EFF and I filed <a href="https://www.eff.org/document/eff-comments-dmca-exemption-abandoned-games" title="EFF Comments on a DMCA Exemption for Abandoned Games">comments</a> with the Copyright Office asking for a new exemption to Section 1201.</p>
