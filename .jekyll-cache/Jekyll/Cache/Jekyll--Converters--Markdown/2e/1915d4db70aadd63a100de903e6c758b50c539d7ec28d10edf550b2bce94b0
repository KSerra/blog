I"U<p>Boing Boing linked to a truly cringe-worthy CNN piece on an EVE player who got buff called “<a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2012/10/26/health/bodybuilder-gamer-avatar-inspiration/index.html?hpt=hp_c2">Virtual Reality: Avatar inspires gamer to hit the gym</a>.”<figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="281" data-orig-width="500"><img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/40af1ad62d52b3f8383a0f073828a357/3b3287d45d2cc83f-f3/s540x810/d65a219958884e730adaa36491197c87b2ce08b1.jpg" data-orig-height="281" data-orig-width="500" /></figure></p>

<p>Just in case anyone missed it, here’s the opening:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The world of “<a href="http://www.eveonline.com/">EVE Online</a>” is brutal. There are enemies and alliances, death and destruction. Gamers fight for territory, profit and fame in a never-ending quest to top their opponent. It’s a bit like the real world that way.</p>

  <p>When Marcus Dickinson first created his “EVE” character, Roc Wieler, the two had little in common. Roc was a retired colonel from the Minmatar tribes – a stoic, physically imposing disciplinarian. Dickinson was a 230-pound Canadian with an affinity for bacon.</p>

  <p>Over time, the line between fiction and reality has blurred. “I’m a role player inherently,“ Dickinson says. “I take it seriously.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>An interesting manifestation of the Proteus Effect, if a bit anecdotal. Also, note the quotes around “EVE Online,” as if CNN was discussing a phenomena that someone had made up.</p>
