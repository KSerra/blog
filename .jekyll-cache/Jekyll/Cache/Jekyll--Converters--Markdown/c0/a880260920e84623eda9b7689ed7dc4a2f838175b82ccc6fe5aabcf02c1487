I"û<p>So an opinion came out of the 7th Circuit yesterday on whether embedding video was a form of copyright infringement. Flava Works was a porn company that had its materials behind a paywall, and myVidster was a bookmarking site that allowed users to embed said material without running into the paywall. Since the 7th Circuit doesnâ€™t allow you to permanently link to a PDF, Iâ€™m linking toÂ <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/5027557/Posner%20Benchslap.pdf">my copy</a>, complete with creative title.</p>
